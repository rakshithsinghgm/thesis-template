{\Large Dedication}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
I would like to dedicate this thesis to my family and advisor, Dr. Paul Robinette. Although completing it took longer than expected, I am grateful for their patience and unwavering support throughout the entire process. They continuously believed in me and my abilities, and for that, I am truly grateful. I only wish I had finished my thesis sooner so my father could have seen me wearing my graduation hat, knowing his efforts paid off in the end. Maybe in another lifetime. Through this journey, I faced many challenges and losses, but I am proud to have persevered and fought my way through. I know that life will present me with more journeys and battles, but at this moment, I am happy to be writing these words.
